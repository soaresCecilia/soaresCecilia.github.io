                Hello, my name is Cecilia Soares, I'm 38 years old and I have a Master degree in Tax Law and a bachelor degree in software engineering from <a href="https://www.uminho.pt/EN/">University of Minho</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                Last school year, I had begun my master degree focused on <b>Distributed Systems</b> and <b>Formal Methods</b>. Currently, I'm writting my master thesis using <a href="https://alloytools.org/"><b>Alloy Language and analyzer</b></a> for
                modeling <b>Vertical Reconfiguration Protocols</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                My first academic degree was in Law and, for several years I've worked as a lawyer. However, some years ago, I had felt a need to change and to embrace a new adventure. Therefore I decided to enrol in Software Engineering Integrated Master. The all experience
                has been very gratifying and enriching.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my free time I'm volunteer at Socieadade Protectora dos Animais de Guimarães
                <a href="https://spaguimaraes.wixsite.com/spaguimaraes"></a>, a local animal rescue association. I like to read and meet new people and cultures also.
            </p>
            <p>
